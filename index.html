      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

      [I would highly recommend the client to obtain an SSL certificate. The
      website will then be able to transfer sensitive and valuable information
      safely over the Internet. That way only those intended to get the data
      will do so. The website will also be authenticated if it has an SSL
      certificate, ensuring that it is sending data to the intended server and
      not a fraudulent one. I would also explain how automatic user timeouts
      could be an effective security measure to implement. If you leave your
      computer unattended or a session window idle for an x amount of time, an
      automatic user timeout would trigger. These timeouts makes sure that
      sessions end when they are no longer in use, limiting the risk of data
      breaches and helps prevent unwanted physical or remote access. Adopting a
      cybersecurity framework could also prove highly efficient. Developing a
      cyber incident response plan along with appropriate application security
      checklists are just two examples of the strategic steps that make up a
      cybersecurity framework. This whole process starts with thorough research
      on security risks.]
